# Work Toolkit: Structuring

Structure content for presentations, docs, and project milestones.

## Quick Start

1. Ask for content type (presentation, doc, outline, milestones).
2. Ask for target audience and goal.
3. Propose a structure and confirm.
4. Expand into a structured outline.

## Frameworks

- Pyramid Principle for executive summaries.
- SCQA for narrative flow.

## Templates

- `references/presentation-templates.md`
- `references/milestone-patterns.md`
