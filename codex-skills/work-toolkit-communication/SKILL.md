# Work Toolkit: Communication

Draft concise, professional German updates for stakeholders and teams.

## Quick Start

1. Ask for audience (stakeholder, team, management, 1:1).
2. Ask for project/context and key updates.
3. Ask for blockers and decisions needed.
4. Draft the message and confirm tone.

## Output Guidelines

- German, semi-formal tone.
- 2-4 bullets per section.
- Lead with outcomes and impact.
- Keep each bullet to one line.

## Templates

Use these references when drafting:
- `references/email-patterns.md`
- `references/status-update-example.md`

## Optional Context Sources

- If project data exists in YouTrack, use it for factual updates.
- If the user provides notes, treat them as source of truth.
