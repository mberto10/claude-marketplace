# Work Toolkit: Meetings

Prepare structured agendas and updates for recurring meetings.

## Quick Start

1. Ask for meeting type (JF, stakeholder update, team sync, Lenkungsausschuss).
2. Ask for date, attendees, and scope (project(s)).
3. Gather data (YouTrack and/or Linear) or use user notes.
4. Draft agenda or update with time boxes and decisions.

## Data Gathering

- For project status and KW updates: use work-toolkit-youtrack.
- For task progress: use work-toolkit-linear.
- If tools are unavailable, ask the user to provide notes or exported data.
