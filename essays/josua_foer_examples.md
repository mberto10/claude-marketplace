If memory is our means of preserving that which we consider most valuable, it is also painfully linked to our own transients. When we die, our memories die with us. In a sense, the elaborate system of externalized memory we have created is a way of fending off mortality. It allows ideas to be efficiently passed across time and space, and for one idea to build on another to a degree not possible when a thought has to be passed from brain to brain in order to be sustained.

The externalization of memory not only changed how people think, it also led to a profound shift in the very notion of what it means to be intelligent. Internal memory became devalued. Erudition evolved from possessing information internally to knowing how and where to find it in the labyrinth world of external memory.

It's a telling statement that pretty much the only space where you will find people still training their memories is at the World Memory Championship and the dozen national memory contests held around the globe. What was once a cornerstone of Western culture is now at best a curiosity.

But as our culture has transformed from one that was fundamentally based on internal memories to one that is fundamentally based on memories outside or stored outside the brain, what are the implications for ourselves and for our society? What we have gained is indisputable. But what have we traded away? What does it mean that we have lost our memory? 

If thinking abotu the word "coffee" makes you think about the color black and also about breakfast and the taste of bitterness, that is a function of a cascade of electrical impulses rocketing around a real physical pathway inside your brain, which links a set of neurons that encode the concept of coffee with others containing the concepts of blackness, breakfast and bitterness. That much scientists know. But how exactly a collection of cells could "contain" a memory reamins among the deepest conundrums of neuroscience.

What we call expertise is really just vast amounts of knowledge, pattern-based retrieval, and planning mechanisms acquired over many years of experience in the associated domain. In other words, a great memory is not just a by-product of expertise, is is the essence of expertise.

Without time, there would be no need for memory. But without a memory, would there be such a thing as time? I don't mean time in the sense that, say, physicists speak of it: the fourth dimension, the independent variable, the quantity that dilates when you approach the speed of light. I mean psychological time, the tempo at which we experience life's passage. Time as a mental construct.

Monotony collapses time;novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next - and disappear. Thats why its important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.
