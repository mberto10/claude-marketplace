This first one is from the author Blake Crouch from the book Recursion. 

This is a paragraph in the beginning of the book where the main characters talk about memory. 

Quote: Because memory is everything. Physically speaking, a memory is nothing but a specific combination of neurons firing together, a symphony of neural activity. But in actuality, it's the filter between us and reality.

You think you are tasting this wine, hearing the words I'm saying, in the present, but there is no such thing. The neural impulses from your taste buds and your ears get transmitted to your brain, which processes them and dumps them into the working memory. So by the time you know you are experiencing something, it's already in the past, already a memory. Just what your brain does to interpret a simple stimulus like that is incredible. The visual and auditory information arrive at your eyes and ears at different speeds and then are processed by your brain at different speeds. 

Your brain waits for the slowest bit of stimulus to be processed. Then reorders the neural inputs correctly and lets you experience them together as a simultaneous event, about half a second after what actually happened. 

We think we are perceiving the world directly and immediately, but everything we experience is this carefully edited tape-delayed reconstruction. 

Another quote that i find fascinating: 

The paradox of the spacious present. What we think of as the present isn't actually a moment, it's a stretch of recent time, an arbitrary one, the last two or three seconds usually. 

But dump a load of adrenaline into your system, get the amygdala to rev up, and you create that hyper-vivid memory where time seems to slow down or stop entirely. If you change the way your brain processes an event, you change the duration of the now. You actually change the point at which the present becomes the past.

It's yet another way that the concept of the present is just an illusion made out of memories and constructed by our brain. It is evident the mind does not know things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them. 

Another one where one main character thinks about the implications: How does one define a simple memory anyway? Is there even such a thing when it comes to the human condition? 

Consider the albatross that landed on the platform during her run this morning. It's a mere flicker of thought in her mind that will one day be cast out into that wasteland of oblivion where forgotten memories die. And yet it contains the smell of the sea, the white, wet feathers of the bird glistening in the early sun, the pounding of her heart from the exertion of the run, the cold slide of sweat down her sides and the burn of it in her eyes. 

Her wandering in that moment where the bird considered home in the unending sameness of the sea. When every memory contains a universe, what does simple even mean?
