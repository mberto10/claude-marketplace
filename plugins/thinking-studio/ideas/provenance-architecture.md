# Provenance Architecture

## My Understanding

How you communicate AI involvement in ways that build rather than erode trust. This is the external surface of the membrane - the interface between your AI-augmented process and the audience.

Provenance isn't just disclosure ("AI was used"). It's a designed communication of: what AI did, what humans did, why you should trust the output, what quality process backed it.

**The key insight:** Transparency should **build confidence** in your process, not just check compliance boxes. Good provenance architecture makes AI involvement a trust signal, not a trust concern.

## Why This Resonates

I saw companies struggle with "do we tell people this was AI-generated?" The binary (disclose/don't disclose) missed the point. The question isn't whether to disclose but *how to communicate involvement in a way that builds trust*.

Provenance architecture reframes it as a design problem, not a compliance problem. You're designing how audiences understand your process - and that design affects whether they trust you more or less.

## Examples That Stuck

**The three levels:**

Level 1 - Disclosure (minimum):
```
[AI-Assisted] This article was drafted with AI assistance
and reviewed by [Human Editor Name]
```

Level 2 - Transparency (better):
```
How this article was created:
- Research aggregation: AI (25 sources analyzed)
- Interviews: Human journalist (3 subjects)
- Writing: AI first draft, human revised (40% rewritten)
- Fact-checking: Human verification
- Final approval: [Senior Editor Name]
```

Level 3 - Confidence Signaling (best):
```
Confidence: High
- All factual claims verified with primary sources
- 3 expert reviews
- Published under editorial standards v2.3

AI Role: Research assistance and draft structure
Human Role: Interviews, fact verification, narrative framing
```

Level 3 turns provenance into a quality signal, not just a disclosure.

**The NYT example:**
> "This investigation involved 6 months of human reporting... AI tools were used to analyze document patterns... All factual claims were independently verified by our Standards desk."

This is provenance as trust-building. You're not apologizing for AI use; you're showing a rigorous process where AI played a defined role.

## How I Use It

I reach for this when:
- Designing content disclosure policies
- Thinking about brand positioning in an AI era
- Evaluating how to communicate AI involvement externally
- Building quality signals into outputs

My trigger question: "How do we communicate AI involvement in a way that *increases* rather than decreases trust?"

## My Explanatory Moves

I usually start with the reframe:

"Most people think disclosure is about compliance - you have to tell people AI was involved. But the real question is: how do you communicate your process in a way that builds confidence?"

"Think of a restaurant kitchen. 'We use machines' isn't a selling point. 'We use precision-temperature circulators as part of our French-trained chef's process' - that's provenance architecture. The machines become part of a quality story."

Then I apply it:

"Same with AI. 'This was AI-generated' raises questions. 'This was AI-drafted, expert-reviewed, fact-checked against primary sources, and published under our editorial standards' - that's provenance that builds trust."

## Tensions & Edges

**Audience expectations vary.** Some audiences want minimal disclosure; others want full transparency. The architecture might need segmentation.

**Provenance can be gamed.** You can design impressive-sounding provenance for a sloppy process. Architecture without substance is just theater.

**The line between transparency and TMI.** Too much detail overwhelms. Not enough feels evasive. Finding the right level is hard.

**Provenance might become table stakes.** If everyone has good provenance architecture, differentiation moves elsewhere. But we're not there yet - it's still a competitive advantage.

**Does provenance matter if quality is high?** At some point, if the output is consistently excellent, does anyone care about the process? Maybe provenance is transitional - important now, less so when trust is established.
