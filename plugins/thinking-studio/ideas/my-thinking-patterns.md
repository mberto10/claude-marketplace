# My Thinking Patterns

## My Understanding

This isn't an idea *about* something - it's a profile of *how I think*. The patterns that show up across my other ideas. My cognitive signature.

Capturing this serves two purposes:
1. Self-awareness: understanding my default moves, biases, blindspots
2. Replication: enabling AI to think *with* me, in my patterns

## Pattern 1: I Think in Systems and Graphs

Not linear cause-effect but **network transformations**. When I analyze something, I instinctively map it as nodes and edges, inputs and outputs, flows and dependencies.

**Where this shows up:**
- Cognitive Transformation Graphs: Knowledge work as directed graphs
- Human-AI Interface Design: Flows between layers
- Skills as Modules: Composable, connectable units

**My trigger:** When I see a process, I ask "what are the nodes? what are the edges?"

**The strength:** Captures complexity without oversimplifying; reveals leverage points

**The blindspot:** Not everything is a network. Some things are irreducibly linear, random, or chaotic. I might force-fit network structure where it doesn't belong.

## Pattern 2: I Use Ecological/Evolutionary Metaphors

I reach for biology - niches, selection pressure, metabolism, membranes - to explain economic and organizational phenomena.

**Where this shows up:**
- Mid-Chain Commoditization: "Digital chloroplasts," species adaptation
- Membrane Model: Biological membrane metaphor
- Value Migration: "Selection pressure migrates"

**Why I trust this:** Economics and ecology share a logic - agents optimizing under constraints, adaptation to scarcity, emergent order from local rules. The metaphor isn't just rhetoric; it's structural isomorphism.

**The strength:** Makes abstract economic dynamics visceral and intuitive

**The blindspot:** Biology metaphors can imply inevitability or naturalism. "Evolution" doesn't mean "good" or "just." I need to be careful not to let the metaphor smuggle in normative claims.

## Pattern 3: I Track Where Scarcity Migrates

Not "what disappears" but "what becomes the new constraint." When abundance appears somewhere, I immediately ask where scarcity relocates.

**Where this shows up:**
- Mid-Chain Commoditization: Abundance in middle → scarcity at boundaries
- Value at Boundaries: Follows the scarcity
- Execution Vaporization: Execution abundant → judgment scarce

**My trigger question:** "If this becomes cheap/abundant, what becomes the new bottleneck?"

**Why I trust this:** Scarcity is conserved - it moves but doesn't disappear. This is almost an economic law of conservation.

**The strength:** Cuts through hype ("X is disrupted!") to the real question ("where does scarcity go now?")

**The blindspot:** Sometimes abundance genuinely eliminates scarcity rather than moving it. Not every constraint migrates; some dissolve. I might be too quick to assume scarcity conservation.

## Pattern 4: I Layer Abstractions

I build understanding in stacks: concrete → abstract → higher abstract. Each layer explains the layer below and is explained by the layer above.

**Where this shows up:**
- Cognitive Transformation Graphs: Transforms → chains → layers → boundaries
- Human-AI Interface Design: Five layers of interface design
- Skills as Modules: Content → skills → library → strategy

**My explanatory move:** Start concrete, add abstraction, then show how abstraction organizes the concrete.

**The strength:** Helps people understand at whatever level they need; creates coherent frameworks

**The blindspot:** I might over-layer, adding abstraction that obscures more than clarifies. Sometimes the concrete is enough.

## Pattern 5: I Seek Inversion and Boundaries

I instinctively ask "what's the opposite?" and "where are the edges?"

**Where this shows up:**
- Value at Boundaries: Where does value *not* go?
- Tensions & Edges in every profile: Where does this idea break down?
- Mid-Chain vs. Boundaries: The middle is defined by what it's *not* (the ends)

**My trigger question:** "What would make this false? Where does this stop working?"

**The strength:** Avoids overconfidence; finds where ideas are load-bearing vs. fragile

**The blindspot:** I might be too quick to qualify. Sometimes the simple version is true enough; I don't need every edge case.

## How These Patterns Interact

They form a coherent method:

1. **Map the system** (Pattern 1) - see the graph structure
2. **Find the current scarcity** (Pattern 3) - where's the bottleneck?
3. **Model the change as ecological shift** (Pattern 2) - what's the new selection pressure?
4. **Identify where scarcity migrates** (Pattern 3) - follow the value
5. **Build layered abstraction** (Pattern 4) - organize understanding
6. **Invert and find edges** (Pattern 5) - stress-test the framework

This is my analytical rhythm. It's not always conscious, but it's consistent.

## What I Might Be Missing

- **Temporal dynamics:** I'm better at equilibrium states than transitions. How things *get* from here to there.
- **Human irrationality:** My frameworks assume agents optimize. Real humans are weird.
- **Power and politics:** Scarcity migration assumes market logic. Sometimes power distorts markets.
- **Emotional/aesthetic dimensions:** I analyze structure more than feeling. This is a gap.

## Using This Profile

When helping me think, an AI should:
- **Map it as a graph** if I'm analyzing a process or system
- **Reach for ecological metaphors** when explaining dynamics
- **Ask where scarcity migrates** when assessing change
- **Build in layers** when explaining complex things to me
- **Always find the edges** where ideas break down

This is my native language. Speaking it helps me think.
