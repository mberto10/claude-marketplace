# Execution Vaporization

## My Understanding

"Following procedures" becomes a computer task. The execution layer of knowledge work - doing what's been decided - vaporizes. Not gradually transforms, not slowly changes: *vaporizes*.

This is the organizational consequence of mid-chain commoditization. If AI can execute documented procedures at near-zero marginal cost, roles defined by execution evaporate. What remains are roles defined by judgment: what to do (front) and vouching for it (back).

The word "vaporization" feels right because it's not replacement or augmentation. It's a phase change. The substance doesn't disappear - it becomes something qualitatively different.

## Why This Resonates

I've watched this happen. Tasks that used to require a person (formatting reports, initial drafts, data aggregation) simply stopped requiring a person. Not "required fewer people" or "became easier" - stopped needing humans at all.

The vaporization framing captures the speed and completeness of this shift better than softer words like "transformation" or "evolution." It's not gradual adaptation; it's sudden disappearance.

It also implies irreversibility. When water vaporizes, you don't expect it to become water again easily. Once execution vaporizes, those roles aren't coming back.

## Examples That Stuck

**The individual leverage explosion:** One person + well-curated skills = former team output. The execution layer that used to require a team is now just... AI.

**The junior role paradox:** Junior roles existed partly for execution (do the routine work) and partly for training (learn by doing). If execution vaporizes, what's the training path? The ladder loses its bottom rungs.

**The "how vs. what" shift:** "How do we do this?" becomes a question AI answers. "What should we do?" remains human. Execution is the "how"; it vaporizes.

## How I Use It

I reach for this when:
- Predicting which roles are most at risk
- Explaining why "AI assists humans" might understate the change
- Thinking about career/skill development priorities
- Designing organizations for an execution-light future

My trigger question: "Is this role primarily about execution (following known procedures) or judgment (deciding what to do)?"

## My Explanatory Moves

I usually start concrete:

"Think of a task you do that's mostly following a procedure - something you could explain to someone in a checklist. Formatting a document. Running a standard analysis. Compiling information from sources into a report."

"Now imagine that task just... stops existing. Not 'gets easier' or 'takes less time' - it's simply not a thing a human does anymore. AI does it. That's vaporization."

Then I draw the implication:

"If your job is 80% execution and 20% judgment, what happens when the 80% vaporizes? You're either in a radically different role or you're out."

## Tensions & Edges

**Not all execution vaporizes equally fast.** Some procedures are harder to document, require more tacit knowledge, depend on physical world interaction. The vaporization is uneven.

**Execution and judgment blur together.** What looks like "execution" often contains embedded judgment calls. The line isn't always clean.

**New execution emerges.** Maybe AI creates new kinds of execution work: prompting, curating, validating. The old execution vaporizes; new execution might condense.

**Vaporization can be resisted.** Organizations, regulations, politics can slow it down. But resistance is usually temporary if the economics are strong enough.

**Human need for "doing."** There's psychological value in execution - the satisfaction of doing a task. What do people do when execution vaporizes? Not just economically, but psychologically?
