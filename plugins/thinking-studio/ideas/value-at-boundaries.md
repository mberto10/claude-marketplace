# Value Migration to Boundaries

## My Understanding

When the middle of the cognitive chain becomes cheap, value concentrates at the **boundaries** - the upstream and downstream ends that remain human-constrained.

**Upstream boundary (front):** Problem-framing, question-asking, defining what success looks like. "What should we do?" becomes exponentially more valuable than "how do we do it?"

**Downstream boundary (back):** Consensus-building, vouching for outputs, getting humans to trust and act on AI-generated work. Social trust and meaning-making.

This is the direct consequence of mid-chain commoditization. The middle becomes throughput; the boundaries become the bottleneck. Economic value follows scarcity.

## Why This Resonates

This clicked because it answered the "so what?" of AI capabilities. Knowing that AI can write/analyze/synthesize doesn't tell you where to invest your career or your company. But knowing that value migrates to boundaries does.

It also matched my intuition that pure execution skills are becoming less valuable. The person who can "do Excel well" is less valuable than the person who knows which spreadsheet to build. The person who can "write clear prose" is less valuable than the person who knows what story to tell.

The boundary framing gave me a vocabulary: I'm trying to position myself at the boundaries, not in the middle.

## Examples That Stuck

**The question hierarchy:**
- "How do we do X?" → Mid-chain, increasingly commoditized
- "What should we do?" → Upstream boundary, increasingly valuable
- "Why should anyone believe/act on this?" → Downstream boundary, increasingly valuable

**Front-end boundary work:**
- Which skills to create/install for your organization
- What constitutes success criteria worth automating toward
- Which tasks merit AI acceleration vs. elimination entirely
- Strategic sequencing: what gets automated when

**Back-end boundary work:**
- Trust arbitration: when to override AI judgment
- Stakeholder negotiation: selling recommendations AI generated
- Ethical boundaries: what the data suggests vs. what should happen
- Relationship continuity: maintaining trust through delegation shifts

## How I Use It

I reach for this when:
- Career planning: Am I building boundary skills or middle skills?
- Org design: Are we staffing the boundaries appropriately?
- Product strategy: Does this tool help at boundaries or just the middle?
- Hiring: Are we overweighting execution skills vs. framing/trust skills?

My trigger question: "Is this work at the boundary or in the middle? If the middle becomes 10x cheaper, does this role become more or less valuable?"

## My Explanatory Moves

I usually set up the before/after:

"Before AI, if you could analyze data or write reports, you were valuable - there was scarcity in the middle of the cognitive chain. Now the middle is flooding with AI capability. It's like water - abundant, cheap, flows everywhere."

"So where's the new scarcity? At the boundaries. Upstream: knowing what question to ask, what problem is worth solving. Downstream: getting humans to trust the output, to act on it, to integrate it into social reality."

Then I make it concrete:

"The analyst who can crunch numbers is competing with AI. The analyst who can figure out which numbers matter and convince the exec team to act - that's boundary work. That's where value goes."

## Tensions & Edges

**Boundaries aren't static.** What counts as "problem-framing" vs. "execution" might shift as AI gets better. Maybe AI eventually helps with framing too. I don't think we're there, but it's not impossible.

**Middle work doesn't disappear overnight.** During the transition, there's still value in being good at mid-chain work, especially supervising AI doing mid-chain work. But the trajectory is clear.

**Boundary work is harder to credential.** "I'm good at Excel" is demonstrable. "I ask the right questions" is harder to prove. This creates hiring and evaluation challenges.

**Not everyone can move to boundaries.** If the economy needs fewer mid-chain workers, what happens to the people displaced? This is a societal question, not just a strategy question.
