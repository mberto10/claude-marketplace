# Compound Engineering Parallels

## My Understanding

Compound engineering (as practiced at Every) is a **worked example** of my broader framework about AI and knowledge work. The parallels aren't coincidental - they're structural. The same underlying dynamics produce the same patterns in different domains.

This profile maps the correspondences explicitly, both to validate my framework and to show how abstract ideas manifest in concrete practice.

## Why This Resonates

Finding compound engineering felt like finding a case study I didn't write. They arrived at similar conclusions from a different starting point (building products with AI) than mine (analyzing AI's impact on knowledge work). Convergent evolution.

The mapping also reveals what my framework predicts vs. what it misses. Compound engineering has operational details my abstract framework lacks. My framework has breadth that compound engineering's domain-specificity lacks. They complement.

## The Core Mappings

### Mid-Chain Commoditization → The "Work" Step

| My Framework | Compound Engineering |
|--------------|---------------------|
| AI floods middle layers with cheap cognition | The "Work" step is 20% of effort |
| Abstraction, reasoning, synthesis commoditized | Agents write code, create tests |
| Near-zero marginal cost for mid-chain | Work becomes almost incidental |

**The parallel:** What I call "mid-chain commoditization" manifests as the work step shrinking to 20%. The actual coding - the transform that used to be scarce - becomes a small fraction of the loop.

### Value at Boundaries → Plan and Review Steps

| My Framework | Compound Engineering |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Value migrates upstream (problem-framing) | Plan step: 40% of effort |
| Value migrates downstream (consensus/trust) | Review step: 40% of effort |
| "What should we do?" > "How do we do it?" | Research and judgment dominate |

**The parallel:** The 80/20 split is my boundary thesis in action. Planning IS the upstream boundary (framing the problem, defining approach). Review IS the downstream boundary (quality judgment, deciding what ships).

### Execution Vaporization → Work Step Shrinkage

| My Framework | Compound Engineering |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Following procedures becomes computer task | Agents execute plans |
| Execution roles vaporize | Developer writes no code directly |
| Phase change, not gradual reduction | 20% isn't "less coding" - it's a different activity |

**The parallel:** "Vaporization" captures the qualitative shift. The compound engineer isn't a coder who codes less. They're a different role entirely - orchestrator, teacher, reviewer.

### Skills as Modules → The Compound Step

| My Framework | Compound Engineering |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Procedures become loadable modules | Lessons become CLAUDE.md entries |
| Institutional knowledge packages | Specialized reviewers accumulate rules |
| Skills library as strategic IP | docs/*.md grows with each cycle |

**The parallel:** The compound step IS skills-as-modules in action. Every cycle deposits packaged knowledge that future cycles load. The mechanism is identical; the implementation details differ.

### Membrane Model → Developer Role

| My Framework | Compound Engineering |
|--------------|---------------------|
| AI core + human membrane | Agents do work; human orchestrates |
| Membrane = taste, judgment, trust | Developer contributes "taste, judgment, context" |
| Brand is filter, not throughput | Quality comes from review, not execution |

**The parallel:** The compound engineer IS the membrane. They don't generate output - they filter, shape, and vouch for what agents generate. Their value is judgment, not throughput.

## What Compound Engineering Adds

Things my framework predicted but didn't operationalize:

1. **The Loop Structure**
   I had "skills accumulate" but not the explicit Plan → Work → Review → Compound cycle. The loop makes accumulation systematic rather than ad-hoc.

2. **The 80/20 Ratio**
   I knew boundaries would matter more, but "80% planning/review, 20% work" is a specific, testable claim. It's more precise than my "value migrates."

3. **Parallel Agent Research**
   Multiple agents researching simultaneously, human synthesizing. This is a specific tactic for leveraging AI abundance I hadn't articulated.

4. **Planning as Teaching**
   "Coding teaches how to solve this problem. Planning teaches how to think about problems like this." This frames the developer's job as teaching the system, not doing the work.

## What My Framework Adds

Things compound engineering assumes but doesn't theorize:

1. **Economic Logic**
   WHY the 80/20 split emerges (mid-chain commoditization). Compound engineering describes the pattern; my framework explains the cause.

2. **Generalization Beyond Engineering**
   The same dynamics apply to journalism, consulting, analysis - any knowledge work graph. Compound engineering is domain-specific; my framework is domain-general.

3. **The Ecological Frame**
   "Digital chloroplasts," "selection pressure migrates" - the metaphors that make the dynamics intuitive. Compound engineering is operational; my framework is also conceptual.

4. **External Membrane (Provenance)**
   Compound engineering focuses on internal process. My framework includes how you communicate AI involvement externally - the trust/transparency layer.

## How I Use This

I reach for this mapping when:
- Validating my framework against real-world practice
- Explaining my abstract ideas with concrete examples
- Looking for operational details my framework lacks
- Checking whether predictions hold in specific domains

My synthesis move: "Here's the theory (my framework). Here's a case study (compound engineering). Notice how the same dynamics produce the same patterns."

## Tensions & Edges

**Convergent evolution vs. same idea:** Are these parallel discoveries or the same insight in different clothes? I lean toward "same underlying dynamics, independently discovered" - which strengthens both.

**Software-specific limitations:** Some compound engineering practices are code-specific (CLAUDE.md, specialized reviewers). The generalizations to other domains need translation, not direct application.

**My framework might be post-hoc fitting:** I found compound engineering after developing my framework. Am I pattern-matching or genuinely validating? Worth holding skeptically.

## Source Passages

From compound engineering:
> "Roughly 80 percent of compound engineering is in the plan and review parts, while 20 percent is in the work and compound."

From my framework:
> "In knowledge work, cheap cognition pushes the competitive frontier upstream to problem-framing and downstream to consensus-building."

The parallel is almost verbatim.
