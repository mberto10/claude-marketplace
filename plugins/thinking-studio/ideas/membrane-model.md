# The Membrane Model

## My Understanding

When AI handles the core cognitive work, organizations become **AI core + human membrane**. The membrane is the interface between AI capability and the outside world - the layer that filters, vouches, and translates.

The membrane is: trust, brand, reputation seal, values filter, human judgment at the edges.

**The key insight:** When everyone can generate outputs using the same AI, differentiation lives in the membrane. Your brand is your filter, not your throughput. Orgs compete on membrane quality.

The membrane determines:
- Whose reputation seals which outputs
- Which organizational values filter recommendations
- What tribal signifiers (voice, humor, positioning) make outputs land
- Who maintains the relationships that translate output into action

## Why This Resonates

I needed a metaphor for the new organizational structure. "AI-augmented" was too vague. "Human-in-the-loop" was too mechanical.

The membrane metaphor clicked because it captures the biology: a cell has a membrane that controls what comes in and out, that gives the cell identity, that interfaces with the environment. The inside is machinery; the membrane is what makes it *this* cell.

It also explains why brand/trust become more important, not less. If the inside is commoditized (anyone can generate), the membrane is all that differentiates.

## Examples That Stuck

**The flow visualization:**
```
Raw request
    ↓
[Skill selection/triggering] ← AI determines relevance
    ↓
[Execution via bundled procedures] ← AI + deterministic code
    ↓
[Output generation] ← AI synthesis
    ↓
[Human review/approval] ← Reputation seal, values filter
    ↓
Stakeholder delivery
```

The bottom two layers are the membrane. Everything above is the core.

**NYT vs. AI-generated news:** Both can produce articles about the same event. The NYT's value isn't the article - it's the membrane: the editorial judgment, the brand trust, the verification process, the reputation stake. That's what you're paying for.

**The membrane as moat:** When everyone has the same AI core, the membrane becomes the competitive moat. A consultancy's membrane is: which partners sign off, what quality bar they enforce, what client relationships they maintain. The actual analysis? AI can do that.

## How I Use It

I reach for this when:
- Thinking about what makes organizations distinct in an AI world
- Designing quality control and approval processes
- Explaining why brand/trust increase in importance
- Analyzing competitive positioning

My trigger question: "What's this organization's membrane? If I swapped out the AI core for a competitor's, what would still be different?"

## My Explanatory Moves

I usually start biological:

"Think of a cell. The inside is machinery - same basic components as any cell. What makes it *this* cell is the membrane - what it lets in, what it lets out, what receptors it has, what it reacts to."

"Organizations are becoming like cells. The inside - the cognitive work - is increasingly generic (AI-powered). What makes your company *your company* is the membrane: your brand, your quality filter, your values, your relationships, your reputation stake."

Then I make it concrete:

"If two companies use the same AI to write articles, what's different? The membrane: who signs off, what gets through, how it's positioned, whose credibility is on the line."

## Tensions & Edges

**Membranes can be too thick.** If humans over-filter AI output, you lose the efficiency gains. Finding the right membrane permeability is hard.

**Membranes can be performed.** You can *claim* human review without actually doing it. The membrane becomes theater. How do you ensure genuine membrane function vs. membrane theater?

**The membrane metaphor might break down.** Biological membranes are relatively simple. Human organizational membranes involve culture, politics, incentives - much more complex. Don't over-lean on the metaphor.

**What happens if AI gets good enough to be its own membrane?** If AI can do the trust/judgment/values work too, does the membrane shrink? I don't think we're there, but it's worth holding as a question.
