# Mid-Chain Commoditization

## My Understanding

AI doesn't commoditize all of knowledge work - it commoditizes the **middle** of the cognitive chain. The transforms in the middle layers (abstraction, reasoning, synthesis) are exactly what LLMs do well. They perform mid-chain cognition at near-zero marginal cost.

The key insight: this creates an **artificial surplus** of what was once scarce. Where once the scarce resource was neuronal labor - human analysts, copywriters, junior developers - we now have a glut. Digital chloroplasts have appeared, taking in tokens and excreting fluent prose, code, and strategy decks.

But the ends of the chain remain constrained. Upstream: problem-framing (what question to ask). Downstream: consensus-building (getting humans to act on outputs). AI floods the middle; the ends become the new bottleneck.

## Why This Resonates

I was looking for the economic logic of AI's impact, not just the technical capabilities. "AI can write" doesn't tell you what happens to wages, org structures, competitive dynamics.

This framing clicked because it follows a pattern I trust: **when you create abundance of one thing, scarcity shifts to complementary things**. Resistance doesn't disappear - it moves. Selection pressure migrates.

The evolution/ecology framing made it visceral: AI rearranges the ecological niche of knowledge work. Species that thrived on mid-chain scarcity (analysts, junior devs) face a changed environment. New niches open at the boundaries.

## Examples That Stuck

**Digital chloroplasts:** This image stays with me. Photosynthesis created an oxygen abundance that transformed Earth's ecology. LLMs create a cognition abundance that transforms the firm's ecology. Same pattern, different substrate.

**The Rakuten case:** "What once took a day, we can now accomplish in an hour." Creating complex spreadsheets - a mid-chain synthesis task - went from day-long to hour-long. Throughput explodes while unit economics crater. That's commoditization in action.

**Junior developer disruption:** The traditional path was: junior dev does routine coding (mid-chain), learns, becomes senior. If AI handles the routine coding, what's the new apprenticeship path? The middle rung of the ladder disappears.

## How I Use It

I reach for this when:
- Predicting which roles/industries face disruption
- Explaining why AI doesn't eliminate jobs but reshapes them
- Analyzing where new scarcity (and value) will emerge
- Designing AI strategy that accounts for shifting economics

My trigger questions:
- "Where in the cognitive chain does this work live?"
- "If the middle becomes cheap, what becomes the new bottleneck?"
- "What was scarce, and what becomes scarce now?"

## My Explanatory Moves

I usually start with the chloroplast metaphor:

"Imagine a factory where the middle step suddenly becomes nearly free - like magic machines appeared that do all the assembly. What happens? You don't need fewer people, you need *different* people. The bottleneck shifts to designing what to assemble and selling what comes out."

Then I apply it to knowledge work:

"LLMs are those magic machines, but for cognition. They flood the middle of the chain. Now the scarce thing isn't 'someone who can analyze data' - it's 'someone who knows what question to ask' and 'someone who can get the organization to act on answers.'"

## Tensions & Edges

**The middle isn't uniformly commoditized.** Some mid-chain work requires judgment that AI can't reliably provide. "Reasoning" is a spectrum from mechanical deduction to wisdom.

**Abundance can create new demand.** Jevons paradox: when something becomes cheap, you use more of it, sometimes increasing total resource consumption. Cheap cognition might mean we do *more* cognitive work, not less.

**Transition dynamics matter.** Even if the equilibrium is "value at boundaries," getting there involves disruption, retraining, organizational resistance. The path matters, not just the destination.

**I'm not certain about the timeline.** The pattern feels right, but whether it's 2 years or 10 years to full mid-chain commoditization - I don't know.
