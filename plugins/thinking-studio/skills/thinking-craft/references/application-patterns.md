# Application Patterns

Common ways to apply profiled ideas to problems.

## Pattern: Direct Application

The idea directly addresses the situation.

**Process:**
1. Identify the relevant idea profile
2. Load "How I Use It" section
3. Apply their trigger questions to the situation
4. Use their examples as analogies

**Example:**
- Situation: "Should I take this job?"
- Relevant idea: Inversion (from their profile)
- Application: "Using your inversion approach - what would guarantee this job makes you miserable? Avoid those things."

## Pattern: Lens Combination

Multiple ideas illuminate different aspects.

**Process:**
1. Identify 2-3 relevant ideas
2. Apply each as a separate lens
3. Note where they agree/conflict
4. Synthesize insights

**Example:**
- Situation: "How should I structure this project?"
- Ideas: Second-order effects + Pre-mortem + Emergence
- Application: Each lens reveals different aspects; combine for fuller picture

## Pattern: Analogy Extension

Their example extends to a new domain.

**Process:**
1. Find a relevant example from their profiles
2. Map the structure: What made it work there?
3. Apply the same structure here
4. Check if the analogy holds

**Example:**
- Their profile: Marriage inversion example
- New domain: Team management
- Extension: "Like your marriage example - don't ask how to build a great team, ask what would guarantee dysfunction. Avoid those."

## Pattern: Tension Navigation

Two ideas pull in different directions.

**Process:**
1. Identify the conflicting ideas
2. Articulate the tension (from their profiles)
3. Don't resolve falsely - hold the tension
4. Ask: Which idea applies MORE here?

**Example:**
- Tension: Move fast vs. Second-order effects
- Navigation: "Your profiles hold this tension. For this decision, which lens matters more?"

## Pattern: Gap Identification

No profiled idea fits.

**Process:**
1. Acknowledge the gap explicitly
2. Check adjacent ideas
3. Offer to profile new material
4. Don't invent - stay grounded

**Example:**
- Situation: Technical architecture decision
- Gap: No systems-thinking ideas profiled
- Response: "Your library doesn't address this directly. Want to profile some ideas about systems/architecture?"

## Pattern: Meta-Application

Applying how they think about thinking.

**Process:**
1. Look across profiles for thinking style patterns
2. How do they approach problems generally?
3. Apply that meta-pattern

**Example:**
- Pattern: User tends to invert before building
- Application: "Based on your profiles, you usually ask 'what would fail?' before 'how to succeed?' - want to do that here?"
