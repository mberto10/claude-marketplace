## Section Guidelines

### My Understanding
- Write as if explaining to yourself
- Use "I" and "for me" language
- Don't copy definitions - translate to your words
- Incomplete understanding is fine - capture where you are

### Why This Resonates
- What were you thinking about when this clicked?
- What gap did it fill?
- Why THIS idea and not similar ones?

### Examples That Stuck
- Personal experiences preferred
- Can include examples from sources IF they're memorable to you
- "The example that made it click was..."

### How I Use It
- Concrete situations where this applies
- What mental trigger activates this idea?
- "I reach for this when..."

### My Explanatory Moves
- How do YOU teach this?
- Your go-to analogy
- The simplified version you use

### Tensions & Edges
- Where does this break down?
- What doesn't it explain?
- Conflicts with other ideas you hold
- "This doesn't help when..."

### Source Passages
- Keep the original material for reference
- Note where it came from
- These anchor your interpretation
