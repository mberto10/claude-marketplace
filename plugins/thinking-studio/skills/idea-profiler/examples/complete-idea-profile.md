# Inversion

## My Understanding

For me, inversion is about approaching problems backwards. Instead of asking "how do I achieve X?" I ask "what would guarantee I fail at X?" Then I avoid those things.

It's not just problem-solving - it's a mindset shift. Most people optimize for success. Inversion optimizes for not-failure, which often gets you further.

The Jacobi framing - "invert, always invert" - sticks with me because it's a reminder that my default forward-thinking is often the wrong approach.

"For me..." and "sticks with me because..." signal personal relationship.

## Why This Resonates

I spent years trying to figure out how to be more productive before realizing I should ask "what makes me unproductive?" The answer was obvious once I inverted: phone in the room, unclear priorities, no boundaries.

This idea clicked because it gave me permission to think "negatively" - which I'd always been told was pessimistic. Turns out it's just practical.

## Examples That Stuck

**The "don't be stupid" investment strategy**: Munger saying the goal isn't to be brilliant, it's to avoid being stupid. Most investors lose by making dumb mistakes, not by missing brilliant opportunities. Just avoid the stupidity.

**Marriage advice**: Instead of "how do I have a great marriage?" ask "what would guarantee a divorce?" Don't do those things. The negative list is clearer than the positive one.

**My productivity reframe**: I stopped asking "how do I get more done?" and started asking "what stops me from getting things done?" The blockers were obvious. The solutions were easy.

## How I Use It

I reach for inversion when:
- I'm stuck on "how do I..." questions
- Planning something important (project, decision, goal)
- The positive path forward seems fuzzy
- I want to stress-test a plan

My trigger question: "What would make this definitely fail?"

I usually do a quick inversion pass before any significant decision. Takes 5 minutes, catches obvious blindspots.

## My Explanatory Moves

When I explain this to someone, I usually say:

"Instead of asking how to succeed, ask what would guarantee failure. The failure modes are usually more obvious. Then just... don't do those things."

I use the marriage example a lot because everyone gets it immediately.

For work contexts, I use: "Don't ask how to make the project succeed. Ask what would make it definitely fail. Now you have a checklist of things to avoid."

## Tensions & Edges

**Doesn't help with the creative/generative part.** Inversion tells you what to avoid, not what to pursue. Good for editing plans, not making them.

**Can become paralyzing.** If you only think about failure modes, you never start. I have to remind myself: inversion is for planning, not for permission-seeking.

**Asymmetry assumption.** Sometimes avoiding failure isn't the same as achieving success. In competitive situations, "not losing" isn't enough.

I don't have a clean resolution for these tensions - I just hold them.

## Source Passages

> "Invert, always invert. Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward." - Carl Jacobi (via Munger)

> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." - Charlie Munger

> "What do you want to avoid? Such an easy answer: sloth and unreliability. If you're unreliable it doesn't matter what your virtues are. You're going to crater immediately." - Munger

## What Makes This Profile Good

1. **Personal voice throughout** - "For me...", "I reach for...", "sticks with me"
2. **Real examples from their life** - The productivity reframe is personal
3. **Honest tensions** - They admit where it breaks down
4. **Actionable** - Clear trigger questions and use cases
5. **Teaching version** - They know how to explain it to others
6. **Sources preserved** - But the interpretation is theirs
