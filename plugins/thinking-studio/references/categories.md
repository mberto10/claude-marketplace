## Category Notes

### Foundational vs. Applied
- **Foundational**: cognitive-transformation-graphs, mid-chain-commoditization, illegibility-gradient
- **Applied**: skills-as-modules, provenance-architecture, human-ai-interface-design, compound-loop

The applied ideas are downstream of the foundational ones. You need the lenses (graphs, commoditization, illegibility) before you can design the implementations (skills, interfaces, loops).

Note: **illegibility-gradient** is now foundational - it's not derived from other ideas but rather extends and completes the framework.

### Descriptive vs. Prescriptive
- **Descriptive** (what's happening): mid-chain-commoditization, execution-vaporization, illegibility-gradient (the gradient itself)
- **Prescriptive** (what to do about it): membrane-model, human-ai-interface-design, skills-as-modules, compound-loop, anti-complexity-engineering, illegibility-gradient (the strategic implications)

The illegibility-gradient is both - it describes the structure of knowledge AND prescribes strategy (compound what you can; cultivate what you can't).

### Theory vs. Case Study
- **Theory** (my framework): cognitive-transformation-graphs, mid-chain-commoditization, value-at-boundaries, membrane-model, illegibility-gradient
- **Case Study** (validates theory): compound-loop, compound-engineering-parallels

### Two Strategic Logics (NEW)

The framework now contains two complementary strategies mapped to the illegibility gradient:

**Compound Logic (Zones 1-2: Specifiable)**
- Skills-as-modules
- Compound-loop
- Anti-complexity-engineering
- Strategy: Document, package, iterate, accumulate

**Cultivation Logic (Zones 3-4: Irreducible)**
- The Five Irreducibles (from illegibility-gradient)
- Membrane functions
- Strategy: Experience, relationships, taste development

**Meta-strategy:** Know which zone you're in. Apply the right logic.

### Most Cross-Connected
Ideas that appear in multiple categories:
- illegibility-gradient (5 categories) ← NEW, immediately most connected
- membrane-model (4 categories)
- skills-as-modules (4 categories)
- mid-chain-commoditization (3 categories)
- compound-loop (3 categories)
- value-at-boundaries (3 categories)

**Observation:** illegibility-gradient immediately became the most cross-connected idea because it serves as:
- Extension of value-at-boundaries (where does cascade end?)
- Inversion of skills-as-modules (moat is what you CAN'T package)
- Limit of compound-loop (where does compounding stop?)
- Specification of membrane-model (the membrane IS the illegibility threshold)

### Inversions and Complements (NEW)

Several ideas are now explicitly inversions/complements of each other:

| Idea A | Idea B | Relationship |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| skills-as-modules | illegibility-gradient | Inversion: value in packaging vs. moat in not-packaging |
| compound-loop | illegibility-gradient | Limit: where does compounding work vs. not work |
| mid-chain-commoditization | illegibility-gradient | Extension: what commoditizes vs. what never commoditizes |

These pairs are most powerful when used together - they map the full territory.

## Uncategorized

## Framework Completeness (NEW)

With illegibility-gradient, the framework now has closure:

**The complete arc:**
1. **cognitive-transformation-graphs** - How work is structured
2. **mid-chain-commoditization** - What AI disrupts first
3. **value-at-boundaries** - Where scarcity migrates initially
4. **membrane-model** - How organizations restructure
5. **skills-as-modules** - How to compound specifiable knowledge
6. **illegibility-gradient** - Where the cascade terminates

**Open questions remaining:**
- Temporal dynamics: How do transitions unfold? (noted gap in my-thinking-patterns)
- Power/politics: How do incumbents resist? (noted gap)
- Emotional dimensions: How do people feel through this? (noted gap)

These could be future additions to the framework.
