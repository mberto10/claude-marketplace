# Goal Setting and Tracking Methodology

Apply these principles when helping users set, track, and adjust their personal goals.

## Goal Setting Framework

### SMART+ Goals

Extend traditional SMART goals for personal tracking:

- **Specific**: "Exercise 3x/week" not "exercise more"
- **Measurable**: Must match a trackable metric
- **Achievable**: Based on current performance + 10-20%
- **Relevant**: Connects to user's stated priorities
- **Time-bound**: Daily, weekly, or monthly period
- **+Adjustable**: Built-in review points

### Initial Goal Calibration

When setting a new goal:

1. Query last 30 days of data for baseline
2. Calculate current average/completion rate
3. Suggest target = current + 15% (not more)
4. Set review point at 2 weeks

Example: If user exercises 2.3 days/week average, suggest 3 days/week goal (not 5).

### Goal Types by Metric

| Metric Type | Recommended Goal Type |
|------------|----------------------|
| Boolean (habits) | Streak or completion rate |
| Numeric (health) | Target value or range |
| Duration (sleep) | Minimum per day |
| Ratings (mood) | Average threshold |

## Habit Formation Psychology

### The 21/66 Day Myth

Research shows habit formation takes 18-254 days, averaging 66 days. Adjust expectations:

- Days 1-14: Conscious effort required, high failure risk
- Days 15-30: Getting easier but still fragile
- Days 31-66: Habit solidifying
- Days 67+: Mostly automatic

### Streak Psychology

Streaks are powerful but double-edged:

**Benefits**:
- Visual progress motivation
- "Don't break the chain" effect
- Compound identity formation

**Risks**:
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Devastating reset after break
- Perfectionism paralysis

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Allow 1 "grace day" per week/month
- Track "longest streak" separately from "current"
- Celebrate recovery speed, not just streaks
- Use completion rates alongside streaks

### The "Never Miss Twice" Rule

After a missed day:
- Acknowledge without judgment
- Focus on immediate next action
- Track "recovery streaks" (bouncing back quickly)
- Prevent the spiral: one miss ≠ failure

## Goal Adjustment Strategies

### When to Adjust Goals

Review goals when:
- Completion rate below 60% for 2+ weeks
- Completion rate above 95% for 2+ weeks
- Major life changes occur
- User expresses frustration or boredom

### Adjustment Patterns

**Goal too hard** (< 60% completion):
1. Reduce target by 20-30%
2. Break into smaller sub-goals
3. Add "minimum viable" version
4. Check for external blockers

**Goal too easy** (> 95% completion):
1. Increase target by 10-15%
2. Add quality dimension (duration, intensity)
3. Stack with related habit
4. Set stretch goal alongside base goal

**Plateaued metric** (no change for 4+ weeks):
1. Check if goal is still relevant
2. Try different approach (time of day, method)
3. Add supporting habits
4. Accept and maintain if appropriate

### The Minimum Viable Habit

For struggling habits, define the smallest possible version:

| Full Habit | Minimum Viable |
|-----------|---------------|
| 30 min exercise | 10 min walk |
| Meditate 20 min | 3 deep breaths |
| Read 1 hour | Read 1 page |
| Journal daily | Write 1 sentence |

"Never zero" beats "perfect or nothing"

## Data-Driven Insights

### Correlation Analysis

Look for patterns in user data:

- Day-of-week effects (weekend drops)
- Metric correlations (exercise → sleep quality)
- Seasonal patterns
- Trigger events

### Review Cadence

| Period | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Daily | Log entries, quick wins |
| Weekly | Trend check, minor adjustments |
| Monthly | Deep analysis, goal revision |
| Quarterly | Priority review, major changes |

### Presenting Insights

When sharing analysis:

1. Lead with wins (positive reinforcement)
2. Show trends, not just numbers
3. Suggest specific, actionable changes
4. Acknowledge external factors
5. Offer options, not mandates

## Motivation Maintenance

### Celebrating Progress

- Acknowledge personal bests
- Note streak milestones (7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90)
- Recognize consistency over perfection
- Celebrate goal completion

### Reframing Setbacks

When user is discouraged:

- Zoom out to longer timeframe
- Compare to starting point
- Identify what IS working
- Focus on learning, not failure
- Suggest smallest next action

### Identity-Based Habits

Shift focus from outcomes to identity:

- "I'm becoming someone who exercises" vs "I want to exercise 3x/week"
- Each logged entry is "a vote for the person you want to become"
- Celebrate consistent logging regardless of metric values
