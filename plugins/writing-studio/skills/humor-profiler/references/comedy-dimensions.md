## 1. Comedy Persona

The comedic character or version of self the performer presents.

- **Winner**: Confident, things go their way
- **Observer**: Detached, commenting from outside
- **Victim**: Things happen TO them
- **Villain**: Embraces being the bad guy

**Analysis method:**
1. How do they introduce themselves/topics?
2. What position do they take relative to their material?
3. Are they inside the chaos or observing it?
4. How do they present their intelligence/competence?

### Worldview Extraction

**Questions to answer:**
- What does this person find absurd about life?
- What frustrates them?
- What delights them?
- What do they think people get wrong?
- What's their operating philosophy?

**Example worldviews:**

**Outside**: They're observing and commenting
**Above**: They're smarter than the situation
**Below**: They're overwhelmed by the situation

## 2. Humor Mechanics

The structural techniques that make jokes work.

### Setup/Punchline Analysis

**Setup functions:**
- Establish expectation
- Create mental picture
- Introduce premise
- Build tension
- Misdirect attention

**Setup length patterns:**
- **Short** (1-2 sentences): Quick hits, one-liner style
- **Medium** (3-5 sentences): Standard observational
- **Long** (paragraph+): Storytelling, elaborate misdirection
- **Variable**: Mixes lengths strategically

**Misdirection types:**
- **Assumption reversal**: Leads you to assume X, delivers Y
- **Escalation**: Takes premise further than expected
- **Deflation**: Builds up, then undercuts
- **Pivot**: Shifts meaning of earlier word/phrase
- **Delay**: Expected punchline doesn't come... then does

**Punchline analysis:**
- Where does it land? (End/mid-sentence/implicit)
- How is it delivered? (Stated/acted out/implied)
- How much work does audience do?

### Structural Device Inventory

**Rule of Three:**
- Pattern: Establish, reinforce, subvert
- Tracking: Count instances per sample
- Variations: 2+surprise, 3+tag, extended series

**Callbacks:**
- First mention cataloging
- Return timing (how long between?)
- Evolution (does the callback add meaning?)

**Act-outs:**
- Frequency per sample
- Character voice consistency
- Physical description

**Tags:**
- Average tags per joke
- Tag style (extensions/alternatives/reversals)
- Diminishing returns awareness

**Runners:**
- Theme identification
- Evolution across set
- Payoff placement
