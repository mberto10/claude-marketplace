## Confidence Score Interpretation

### 90-100: High Confidence
- Profile highly reliable

- Minor calibration only
- Style is well-captured

### 70-89: Good Confidence

- Some edges may be soft
- Review output against samples
- May miss occasional nuances

### 50-69: Moderate Confidence
- Useful but verify carefully
- Core captured, details may drift
- Compare output to samples frequently
- Consider gathering more samples

### Below 50: Low Confidence
- Treat as starting point
- Significant gaps likely

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Over-relying on Catchphrases
**Problem:** Using signature phrases too frequently
**Solution:** Catchphrases should be rare—use sparingly for authenticity

### Pitfall 2: Missing the Worldview
**Problem:** Getting mechanics right but persona wrong
**Solution:** Always start with "how would they see this?" before "how would they phrase it?"

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Target Selection
**Problem:** Targeting things they wouldn't target
**Solution:** Review protected targets; check attack style before aiming

### Pitfall 4: Timing Mismatch
**Problem:** Jokes land wrong because rhythm is off
**Solution:** Read aloud; match beat placement patterns

### Pitfall 5: Edge Drift
**Problem:** Going edgier or safer than their style
**Solution:** Check taboo navigation section; match their line

### Pitfall 6: Sincerity Mismatch
**Problem:** Too earnest or too jokey for their balance
**Solution:** Review sincerity balance; match their genuine moment frequency

## Testing Your Output

### Blind Test
Could someone familiar with this comedian identify the style?
- Read it to someone who knows the comedian
- Ask: "Who does this sound like?"
- If they can't tell, calibrate harder

### Checklist Validation
- [ ] Persona consistent throughout?
- [ ] Mechanics match their patterns?
- [ ] Targets appropriate?
- [ ] Edge level correct?
- [ ] Timing feels right when read aloud?
- [ ] Would they find this funny?

### Anti-Pattern Check
Review the anti-patterns section:
- Are you doing anything on the "never" list?
- Does anything feel off-brand?
- Would this embarrass them by association?
