# Common Joke Structures and Patterns

Reference guide for identifying and replicating comedy structures.

---

## Basic Structures

### Setup → Punchline
The fundamental unit of comedy.

```
Setup: Establishes expectation or context
Punchline: Subverts, reverses, or exceeds expectation
```

**Example:**
- Setup: "I haven't slept for ten days..."
- Punchline: "...because that would be too long." (Mitch Hedberg)

### Setup → Punchline → Tag(s)
Extended form with additional laughs.

```
Setup: Context
Punchline: Main laugh
Tag 1: Extension/callback
Tag 2: Further extension
Tag 3: Final button
```

---

## Misdirection Types

### Assumption Reversal
Lead audience to assume X, deliver Y.

```
Pattern: [Statement implying A] + [Reveal it's actually B]
```

**Example:** "I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too." (Mitch Hedberg)

### Escalation
Take premise further than expected.

```
Pattern: [Normal situation] → [Slightly exaggerated] → [Absurdly extreme]
```

### Deflation
Build up importance, then undercut.

```
Pattern: [Grand setup] → [Anticlimactic reveal]
```

### Pivot/Reframe
Shift meaning of earlier word or phrase.

```
Pattern: [Statement with ambiguous word] → [Reveal alternate meaning]
```

---

## Rule of Three

### Standard Pattern
Establish, reinforce, subvert.

```
1. Sets pattern
2. Confirms pattern
3. Breaks pattern (laugh)
```

**Example:** "I like my coffee like I like my women: hot, strong, and [unexpected third thing]."

### Variations

**2 + Surprise:**
```
1. Expectation
2. Confirmation
3. Wild departure
```

**3 + Button:**
```
1. Pattern
2. Pattern
3. Break
4. Final tag
```

**Extended Series:**
```
1-5. Building pattern
6. Break (bigger because of buildup)
```

## Callback Structures

### Simple Callback
Reference earlier joke for additional laugh.

```
Early in set: [Joke A with distinctive element]
Later: [Reference to distinctive element] → laugh from recognition
```

### Evolved Callback
Callback adds meaning or escalates.

```
Original: [Joke about X]
Callback: [X in new context, now funnier because of earlier setup]
```

### Structural Callback
Entire set builds to callback payoff.

```
[Multiple bits plant elements]
[Final bit combines all elements]
```

## Storytelling Structures

### The Narrative Arc
Traditional story structure applied to comedy.

```
1. Setup the world
2. Introduce conflict/absurdity
3. Escalate through complications
4. Peak absurdity
5. Resolution/button
```

### The Reveal Structure
Story building to surprising information.

```
1. Tell story with missing context
2. Details accumulate
3. Reveal recontextualizes everything
4. Tags mine the reveal
```

### The Parallel Structure
Two stories that intersect.

```
1. Story A begins
2. Story B introduced
3. Stories interweave
4. Stories collide for payoff
```

## Act-Out Patterns

### Character Voice
Become another person in the story.

```
Narrator voice: "So my dad says to me..."
Character voice: [Different voice/affect] "..."
Narrator: [Reaction]
```

### Exaggerated Recreation
Perform action with comedic amplification.

```
1. Describe situation
2. Act out with physical/vocal exaggeration
3. Return to narrator
```

### Internal Monologue
Voice your thoughts in the moment.

```
Narrator: "And I'm standing there thinking..."
Internal: [Panicked/absurd thoughts]
```

---

## Observational Patterns

### "Have You Ever Noticed"
Classic observational structure.

```
1. Point out universal experience
2. Describe specifics
3. Exaggerate or extrapolate
4. Land on insight/absurdity
```

### The Comparison
Juxtapose two things for comedy.

```
Pattern: "[Thing A] is like [surprising Thing B] because [connection]"
```

### The Rant Build
Escalating frustration comedy.

```
1. Minor annoyance stated
2. Escalation of frustration
3. Peak absurd anger
4. Deflation or button
```

---

## Dark Comedy Patterns

### Tragedy + Time + Angle
Making difficult subjects funny.

```
1. Acknowledge the darkness
2. Find unexpected angle
3. Commit to the angle
4. Don't apologize
```

### The Release Valve
Building tension, then releasing.

```
1. Create discomfort
2. Hold discomfort
3. Release through laughter
4. Optional: go back in
```

---

## Self-Deprecation Patterns

### The Reveal
Pretend competence, reveal failure.

```
1. Set up normal situation
2. Describe your failure
3. Details make it worse
4. Ultimate humiliation
```

### The Embrace
Own the flaw proudly.

```
1. State flaw
2. Elaborate
3. Demonstrate why it's actually... still bad
4. But you're okay with it
```

---

## Wordplay Structures

### The Pun
Word with double meaning.

```
Setup: Uses word in expected context
Punchline: Same word, different meaning
```

### The Malapropism
Wrong word, funnier meaning.

```
Pattern: Expected phrase → slightly wrong version → reveals truth
```

### Sound Play
Words that sound similar.

```
Pattern: Expectation of word A → delivery of similar-sounding word B
```

## Timing Notation

When analyzing or constructing jokes, note timing:

```
[pause] - Brief beat
[beat] - Slightly longer pause
[hold] - Extended silence
[quickly] - Rapid delivery
[building] - Escalating speed
[dropping] - Slowing down
```

## Structure Identification Checklist

When analyzing a joke:

1. What's the setup length? (short/medium/long)
2. What type of misdirection? (reversal/escalation/deflation/pivot)
3. Where does punchline land? (end/mid/implied)
4. How many tags follow?
5. Does it callback to earlier material?
6. What voice/persona delivers it?
7. What's the target? (self/other/absurdity)
8. What's the timing pattern?

## Applying Structures

When generating in a comedian's style:

1. **Identify their preferred structures** from sample analysis
2. **Apply their typical setup length** to new premises
3. **Use their misdirection type** for turns
4. **Match their tag density** after punchlines
5. **Employ their callback style** for connections
6. **Maintain their timing patterns** in construction
