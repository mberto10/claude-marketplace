# Common Weakness Patterns

Reference guide for identifying and fixing common weaknesses by category.

## Hook Weaknesses

### Pattern: Definition Opening
**Issue:** Opens by defining the topic
**Example:** "Productivity is the measure of output per unit of input..."
**Fix:** Lead with a specific claim, question, or story instead
**Severity:** Usually Major

### Pattern: "In today's world" Opening
**Issue:** Generic time-based framing
**Example:** "In today's fast-paced world, we all struggle with..."
**Fix:** Start with something specific and concrete
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Throat-Clearing
**Issue:** Several sentences before getting to the point
**Example:** "I've been thinking a lot about productivity lately. There are many aspects to consider. Let me share some thoughts..."
**Fix:** Cut first 2-3 sentences, start where it gets interesting
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Burying the Lead
**Issue:** Best hook material is in paragraph 2 or 3
**Example:** Good insight appears in paragraph 3, generic setup in paragraph 1
**Fix:** Move the compelling content to the opening
**Severity:** Major

## Voice Weaknesses

### Pattern: Pronoun Drift
**Issue:** Profile uses "we" but draft switches between I/we/you/one
**Example:** "We often think... I believe... You might notice... One could argue..."
**Fix:** Commit to the profile's pronoun system throughout
**Severity:** Major (affects voice consistency)

### Pattern: Missing Signatures
**Issue:** Profile has distinctive moves that don't appear
**Example:** Profile uses "Consider:" pivots but draft has none
**Fix:** Identify 3-4 natural places to insert signature moves
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Anti-Pattern Violations
**Issue:** Draft uses words/phrases the profile explicitly avoids
**Example:** Profile avoids "utilize" but draft uses it twice
**Fix:** Find-replace with approved alternatives
**Severity:** Critical (direct profile violation)

### Pattern: Tonal Inconsistency
**Issue:** Voice shifts between sections
**Example:** Section 1 is conversational, Section 2 sounds like a textbook
**Fix:** Rewrite inconsistent sections to match dominant tone
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Over-Performing the Voice
**Issue:** Signature elements feel forced or too frequent
**Example:** "Consider:" appears in every paragraph
**Fix:** Reduce to 2-3 natural occurrences
**Severity:** Minor

## Structure Weaknesses

### Pattern: Missing Transitions
**Issue:** Sections jump without connection
**Example:** Section on problem ends, section on solution starts with no bridge
**Fix:** Add 1-2 sentence transitions between major sections
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Over-Signposted
**Issue:** Transitions are clunky and obvious
**Example:** "Now let's move on to discuss the second point..."
**Fix:** Use implicit transitions, let ideas connect naturally
**Severity:** Minor

### Pattern: Section Purpose Unclear
**Issue:** Reader doesn't know why a section exists
**Example:** Long tangent that doesn't clearly serve thesis
**Fix:** Either cut or make connection to thesis explicit
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Pacing Problems
**Issue:** Some sections too long, others too short
**Example:** Minor point gets 500 words, major point gets 100
**Fix:** Rebalance based on importance
**Severity:** Minor to Major

## Evidence Weaknesses

### Pattern: Abstract Claims Without Support
**Issue:** Makes claims without examples
**Example:** "People often struggle with time management."
**Fix:** Add specific example, statistic, or story
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Generic Examples
**Issue:** Examples are vague placeholders
**Example:** "For example, a company might use this approach."
**Fix:** Use specific, named, detailed examples
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Wrong Evidence Type
**Issue:** Evidence style doesn't match profile
**Example:** Profile favors anecdotes but draft uses only statistics
**Fix:** Replace or supplement with profile-appropriate evidence
**Severity:** Minor to Major

### Pattern: Over-Explained Evidence
**Issue:** Beats the example to death
**Example:** Example followed by 3 paragraphs explaining what it means
**Fix:** Let evidence speak for itself, trust the reader
**Severity:** Minor

## Rhythm Weaknesses

### Pattern: Sentence Monotony
**Issue:** All sentences similar length
**Example:** Every sentence 15-20 words, no variation
**Fix:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer complex ones
**Severity:** Minor to Major

### Pattern: Paragraph Walls
**Issue:** Dense paragraphs without breaks
**Example:** 200-word paragraphs with no white space
**Fix:** Break into smaller paragraphs, add breathing room
**Severity:** Minor

### Pattern: Staccato Overload
**Issue:** Too many short sentences in a row
**Example:** "This is key. It matters. You should care. Here's why."
**Fix:** Combine some sentences, vary rhythm
**Severity:** Minor

---

## Conclusion Weaknesses

### Pattern: Summary Conclusion
**Issue:** Just restates what was said
**Example:** "In conclusion, we discussed X, Y, and Z."
**Fix:** End with insight, callback, or forward-looking thought
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: New Tangent
**Issue:** Introduces new ideas in conclusion
**Example:** "And another thing to consider is [totally new topic]..."
**Fix:** Cut new material or move to body
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Trailing Off
**Issue:** Energy drops, piece just stops
**Example:** Last paragraph is weakest in piece
**Fix:** End on strongest note, cut weak final sentences
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Overstated Conclusion
**Issue:** Claims more than the piece delivered
**Example:** "This will change everything about how you think about productivity."
**Fix:** Match conclusion energy to piece substance
**Severity:** Minor

## Clarity Weaknesses

### Pattern: Buried Thesis
**Issue:** Main point is unclear or hidden
**Example:** Thesis appears in paragraph 4 instead of being clear early
**Fix:** Make thesis explicit and early (unless intentionally building to it)
**Severity:** Critical

### Pattern: Competing Ideas
**Issue:** Multiple theses fighting for attention
**Example:** Piece argues A, B, and C without clear hierarchy
**Fix:** Pick one main thesis, subordinate others
**Severity:** Critical

### Pattern: Jargon Overload
**Issue:** Too much unexplained technical language
**Example:** Assumes reader knows field-specific terms
**Fix:** Define or replace jargon based on audience level
**Severity:** Major

### Pattern: Logical Gaps
**Issue:** Argument jumps without connecting reasoning
**Example:** "A is true. Therefore Z." (Missing B through Y)
**Fix:** Fill in reasoning steps
**Severity:** Major to Critical
