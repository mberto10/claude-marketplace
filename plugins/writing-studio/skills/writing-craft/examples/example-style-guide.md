## Example Excerpts

### Opening Hooks

**Technical:**
> "Here's what nobody tells you about error handling: the try-catch block is often the least important part. We'll look at why prevention beats cure, and how to design systems that rarely need exception handling in the first place."

**Creative:**
> "The coffee shop was exactly wrong. Wrong lighting, wrong music, wrong everything. And somehow, that's where I finally figured out what I'd been missing for three years."

**Business:**
> "We need to make a decision on the Q4 launch by Friday. Here's what I recommend and why."

### Transitions

**Building on a point:**
> "Here's the thing: this only works if we're honest about the tradeoffs."

**Shifting direction:**
> "But that's only half the story."

**Introducing complexity:**
> "It gets more interesting when we consider..."

### Conclusions

**Technical:**
> "The best error handling is the kind you never have to write. Design for the happy path, validate at the boundaries, and let the rest take care of itself."

**Creative:**
> "She closed the laptop and looked out the window. The answer had been there the whole time. She just hadn't been ready to see it."

**Business:**
> "If you're aligned with this direction, let me know and I'll start on next steps. Happy to discuss if you have concerns."

## Style Notes

### Voice Consistency

Even when adapting for different writing types, maintain these constants:
- First-person plural when addressing shared experiences
- Direct statements over hedged suggestions
- Concrete examples for every abstract claim
- Humor through observation, not forced jokes

### Things to Avoid

- Starting sentences with "In order to" (just say what to do)
- Passive voice unless intentionally hiding agency
- Jargon when plain words work
- Apologetic language ("I just wanted to...", "Sorry, but...")
- Exclamation points except in genuinely exciting moments

### Evolution Notes

**Last updated:** [Date]

**Recent changes:**
- Added "circle back" to prohibited words (was overusing)
- Softened stance on semicolons (now "rare" not "never")
- Added business writing type with specific notes

**To revisit:**
- Consider whether em-dash usage is getting excessive
- Check if "actually" is appearing too often
